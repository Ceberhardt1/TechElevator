Test that demonstrates problem: getbillablehours

Expected output: 1

Actual output: 2.5

How did you fix this bug? Sql was using SUM, So you need to take it out to just get the hours worked.


Bug 4

Test that demonstrates problem:
Billable method

Expected output: billing timesheets that are billable.

Actual output: billing every timesheet.

How did you fix this bug?
updated interface and timesheetDao, by accounting for the boolean (billable), to see if the timesheets were billable.
